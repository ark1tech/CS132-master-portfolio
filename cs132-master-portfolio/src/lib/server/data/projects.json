The data on the level of urbanization of each region was utilized to classify areas as either urban or rural. As seen in the bar graph, urban regions have a higher overall population. One of the reasons could be due to the influx of individuals moving to cities in search of better employment opportunities. However, urban regions also have a larger number of residents living in poverty. This suggests that for all opportunities urban regions provide, it also comes with major challenges, such as higher cost of living, trapping Filipinos in poverty. On the other hand, rural areas, while having smaller populations, tend to experience less poverty. Overall, this graph shows the need for effective poverty alleviation programs that specifically address the diverse and complex challenges faced in urban and rural settings.",

			"title": "Rice Supply & Prices: Insights for Philippine Food Security",
			"desc": "Rice is a crucial staple food in Filipino households, yet the cost of rice steadily rises despite promises to lower grain prices. According to PSA, rice inflation increased from 19.6% in December 2023 to 22.6% in January 2024. Furthermore, the World Food Program (WFP) October 2022 report said 1 out of 10 households in the Philippines faced food insecurity. Hence, we aim to explore the correlation between rice supply—Local Rice Production, Imports, and Stocks—and the Retail Prices of different types of rice (Special, Well Milled, Regular Milled) from 1995-2023 to offer insights to policymakers in ensuring food security in the Philippines. Through Spearman’s rank correlation, the nutshell plot revealed a strong positive correlation between local rice production and retail prices with coefficients of 0.95-0.97, suggesting that retail price increases with local production, contrary to the supply and demand expectations, likely influenced by increasing population and demand for rice. Moderate correlation exists between rice imports and retail prices with coefficients ranging from 0.47-0.54, potentially due to factors necessitating increased imports and import restrictions pre-Rice Tariffication Law. Similarly, moderate correlation exists between rice stocks and retail prices with coefficients of 0.43-0.44, likely influenced by inclusion of household stocks that do not affect retail prices. These findings highlight the importance of correlation analysis in identifying confounding variables and policy responses in agriculture. Hence, to address the confounding variable for local production, we further measured the self-sufficiency level of the Philippines in rice by obtaining the ratio of production to consumption that indicates how well local rice production meets national rice consumption demands. Moderate negative correlation between the ratio of production to consumption and retail prices with -0.3 to -0.43 coefficients suggests that higher self-sufficiency corresponds to lower prices. Leveraging these insights can help in enhancing food security in the Philippines.",

Over the course of 20 years, both can be seen to deviate; as food production grows annually, national hunger shrinks over time. Thus, there's reason to speculate a direct causal relationship between the two, as the behavior of spikes between one variable can also trigger an indirectly proportional spike to the other (e.g. 2011). Moreover, it can also be seen that there are evident periods wherein Food Production Growth trends upwards, while Hunger Growth trends oppositely downwards (e.g. 2015-2020). Overall, this could mean that a general increase in the growth of Food Production will eventually counter and conquer Hunger Growth within the country in the forthcoming future.",

In the past few years as well, food prices have not always been consistent. This plot illustrates the prices of several food items commonly found in a Filipino household over the years 2020 to 2024, with information sourced from the World Food Programme (WFP) Price Database. This is depicted using a 3D line graph, with each line displaying the trend in price of a specific food item over time. A number are seen to be maintaining a relatively consistent price range (Eggs, Rice, Bananas, Chicken, Fish), while others frequently rise and fall in price (Carrots, Tomatoes, Red Onions). A few are also seen to be gradually rising in price (Beef, Pork) or gradually lowering in price (Garlic).",

The y-axis represents the price in Philippine pesos (PHP), while the x-axis spans the years from 2010 to 2024. Starting at approximately Php 28.00 in 2010, the price of rice has shown a general upward trend, reaching up to Php 45.00 in recent years. This increase is punctuated by several notable peaks that correspond to key market conditions and economic events. In January 2014, a significant price increase due to rampant hoarding, leading to a shortage of rice. Meanwhile, in December 2016, another spike in prices occurred, attributed to supply shortages in several regions due to prolonged El Nino and typhoons. In February 2018, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) announced a rice crisis, causing a substantial rise in prices. This is countered by the enactment of the Rice Tariffication Law in March 2019. This initially resulting in a decline in prices due to the liberalization of rice imports. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic on April 2020 led to a price freeze as a lockdown measure, stabilizing the prices temporarily. Lastly, in the 3rd quarter of 2023, a sharp increase in prices was observed, driven by a rising inflation rate. Overall, the graph highlights how various crises, policy changes, and economic conditions have impacted the wholesale price of rice in the Philippines over the years. With rice being a staple and main food consumed by Filipinos, this significantly highlights the pressing rice insecurity that the country deals with.",

Poverty threshold is defined by the PSA as the monthly minimum income required for a family to meet the basic food and non-food requirements. The x-axis represents the date, while the y-axis represents the price of the minimum wage/poverty threshold in Philippine pesos (PHP). Minimum wage is at a daily rate, while poverty threshold is at a monthly rate, so the poverty threshold was divided by 30 to make it daily.

Minimum wage in the non-NCR regions is lower than the NCR minimum wage by around 100 to 200 pesos for the last 20 years. Conversely, the poverty threshold of the NCR is lower than that of the non-NCR regions by 100 pesos. This shows that Metro Manila, being the economic center of the country, can offer higher wages and cheaper goods.<br><br>The plot also shows that wages are not keeping up with cost of living. In fact, the gap between cost of living and minimum wage, both in the NCR and outside of it, has been steadily increasing in the last 20 years. This is shown by how the regression lines for the poverty threshold are slightly steeper than the regression lines for minimum wage.

Each bar represents the number of generators of a hazardous waste code, with hazardous waste codes described in words instead of their original alphanumeric string. The colors of the bars indicate grouping via hazardous waste codes, which is indicated by the letter that starts the hazardous waste code. For example, electronic waste, pathogenic/infectious waste and pharmaceuticals/drugs all fall under miscellaneous hazardous waste and thus have the same bar color. The color mappings for these groupings are shown at the upper right of the bar graph. On the other hand, the heatmap indicates the amount of hazardous waste produced by each region in 2022. The colormap used is magma, which ranges from purple to yellow. Darker shades of purple indicate less hazardous waste generated, while lighter shades of yellow indicate more hazardous waste generated. The color values for the amount of trash generated is shown to the left of the heat map. Also, the tons of hazardous waste produced by the NCR in 2022 is shown below the heatmap of the Philippines.",

The white areas are areas not represented in the scraped data from Lamudi. From the data gathered and looking at the graphs, houses are most expensive on average in Cebu and NCR while it is least expensive in Iloilo. Lots in general are most expensive on average in NCR and least expensive in South Cotabato. Lastly, Condo Units are most expensive in Aklan and NCR while it is least expensive in Cavite. Overall, the graphs show the differences of real estate pricing across different provinces in the Philippines which can be helpful for aspiring homeowners and those looking into buying or investing in real estate.",

Water quality was calculated as the mean of the 'passes' for all parameters using the formula: number of passes / total number of parameters.

Jalaur River: Dirtiest, passing 4/10 parameters in 2019 and improving by 1 parameter each year. Guadalupe River: Passed 5/10 parameters in 2019 and 2020, and 6/10 in 2021.
