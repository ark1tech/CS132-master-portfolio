Furthermore, the World Food Program (WFP) October 2022 report said 1 out of 10 households in the Philippines faced food insecurity.<br><br>Hence, we aim to explore the correlation between rice supply‚ÄîLocal Rice Production, Imports, and Stocks‚Äîand the Retail Prices of different types of rice (Special, Well Milled, Regular Milled) from 1995-2023 to offer insights to policymakers in ensuring food security in the Philippines.<br><br>Through Spearman's rank correlation, the nutshell plot revealed a strong positive correlation between local rice production and retail prices with coefficients of 0.95-0.97, suggesting that retail price increases with local production, contrary to the supply and demand expectations, likely influenced by increasing population and demand for rice. Moderate correlation exists between rice imports and retail prices with coefficients ranging from 0.47-0.54, potentially due to factors necessitating increased imports and import restrictions pre-Rice Tariffication Law. Similarly, moderate correlation exists between rice stocks and retail prices with coefficients of 0.43-0.44, likely influenced by inclusion of household stocks that do not affect retail prices.<br><br>These findings highlight the importance of correlation analysis in identifying confounding variables and policy responses in agriculture. Hence, to address the confounding variable for local production, we further measured the self-sufficiency level of the Philippines in rice by obtaining the ratio of production to consumption that indicates how well local rice production meets national rice consumption demands. Moderate negative correlation between the ratio of production to consumption and retail prices with -0.3 to -0.43 coefficients suggests that higher self-sufficiency corresponds to lower prices.<br><br>Leveraging these insights can help in enhancing food security in the Philippines.",

In January 2014, a significant price increase due to rampant hoarding, leading to a shortage of rice.

Coupled with the slower increase in the average Minimum Wage (green line), electricity is made even more expensive by the fact that its increasing price takes more budget away from other household expenses (such as food) which are also getting more expensive.<br><br>Additionally, electricity price is frequently the highest around the month of April, when weather is the hottest in the Philippines, resulting to increased electricity demand for fans and air conditioning.",

For this plot, we used the poverty threshold as our metric for cost of living. Poverty threshold is defined by the PSA as the monthly minimum income required for a family to meet the basic food and non-food requirements. The x-axis represents the date, while the y-axis represents the price of the minimum wage/poverty threshold in Philippine pesos (PHP). Minimum wage is at a daily rate, while poverty threshold is at a monthly rate, so the poverty threshold was divided by 30 to make it daily. The average of the poverty thresholds of the non-NCR regions was taken and used to determine the poverty threshold for the rest of the Philippines.<br><br>The plot shows the disparity of cost of living and wages between the NCR and the rest of the country. Minimum wage in the non-NCR regions is lower than the NCR minimum wage by around 100 to 200 pesos for the last 20 years. Conversely, the poverty threshold of the NCR is lower than that of the non-NCR regions by 100 pesos. This shows that Metro Manila, being the economic center of the country, can offer higher wages and cheaper goods.<br><br>The plot also shows that wages are not keeping up with cost of living. In fact, the gap between cost of living and minimum wage, both in the NCR and outside of it, has been steadily increasing in the last 20 years. This is shown by how the regression lines for the poverty threshold are slightly steeper than the regression lines for minimum wage. This shows that despite a rise in minimum wages, Filipinos living off of minimum wage still cannot afford to meet basic food and non-food requirements.",

For instance, Workplace Management is relatively separate from Employee Exit Process, which could mean employees quit for reasons other than workplace management. BPO Work & Culture is closely related to Workplace Management and Job Application but relatively isolated from the others. This may be because BPO is a leading industry. Job Application dabbles with the others but ties closely with Employee Exit Process since an exit from a job usually means applying for another one.

The Y-axis represents the years, while the color gradient shows water quality: green indicates poorer quality, blue indicates better quality. Water quality was calculated as the mean of the 'passes' for all parameters using the formula: number of passes / total number of parameters.<br><br>Key observations include: Bagatayam River: Cleanest, passing all parameters in 2020 and 2021, and 8/10 in 2019. Jalaur River: Dirtiest, passing 4/10 parameters in 2019 and improving by 1 parameter each year. Guadalupe River: Passed 5/10 parameters in 2019 and 2020, and 6/10 in 2021. Pampanga River: Consistent, passing 7/10 parameters over the three years.<br><br>Overall, the graph shows a general improvement in water quality over this period.",
